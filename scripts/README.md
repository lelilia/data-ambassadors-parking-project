# Scripts

* **preprocessing (alex).ipynb** This script was written by Alex and is a playground to pre-processing the street data, namely downloading OSM-data with Python
with the osmnx library. 
* **analyzing_geojson.ipynb** This scrpt is a first attempt to combine the OSM-street dataset with the cartagger data by Hans Hack.

## To-do

This file could be cleaned up and serve to download OSM-data for F-Kr.
