# Data Ambassadors Parking Project by DSSG

This project folder is the backbone for the Data Ambassadors Parking Project, curated by DSSG. The goal of this repository is to collect and analyse parking data by the district Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, in order to generate ideas and evaluate data for the upcoming hackathon by DSSG in November 2021.  

# To-Dos

## Questions where we have the data for (I think) and where Simon is interested in:
* Parking space vs. counted (registered?) cars 
* Demographic visualisations about Friedrichshain Kreuzberg
* do cars correlate with age?
* do cars correlate with background of inhabitants (german vs foreign)
* do cars correlate with gender?
* visualisation of parking spaces for disabled persons - how does that correlate with other demographics?
* how do parking zones influence parking in Friedrichshain Kreuzberg?
* how do rental cars influence parking in Friedrichshain Kreuzberg?

--> maybe we have to reframe that a bit - I don't think we should only look at correlations but patterns within the different datasets.

Whenever you have the final data folder with everything needed included, I would ask you (or I can do it as well) to download them to a google shared drive as this is what we are going to share with the volunteers (as maybe not all of them are familiar with github).
