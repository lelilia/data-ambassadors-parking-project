# Data Ambassadors Parking Project by DSSG

## This project folder is the backbone for the Data Ambassadors Parking Project, curated by DSSG. The goal of this repository is to collect and analyse parking data by the district Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, ideally to generate ideas and data for the upcoming hackathon by DSSG in November 2021.
